              It's Champions League time once again so we've asked Joris Becq
              from the Belgian Football Podcast to share a bit of his knowledge
              and give us the lowdown on our first visitors to St. Petersburg,
              Club Brugge.

              <h3>SQUAD</h3>
              <p>
                First of all, Brugge’s squad has remained almost unchanged
                compared to last season. None of the key players left the club,
                Club Brugge is still relying on the solid foundations that
                brought them three titles in the past five years, as well as to
                four participations in the Champions League group stage.
              </p>
              <p>
                In goal there is Mignolet, the former Sunderland and Liverpool
                goalkeeper, who has been an excellent solution for Club’s
                struggles in goal in the years prior. Unfortunately, he won’t be
                able to feature in this first game because of a positive
                COVID-test. Horvath will be his replacement, he hasn’t played a
                game for Brugge in more than a year.
              </p>
              <p>
                In defence, right-back Mata is probably the most underrated
                player in the squad. He’s been solid as a rock for them during
                the last two seasons. Left-back will be Sobol, in central
                defence Deli, a physically strong guy, usually teams up with
                Mechele, who is good at positioning. Deli is suspended for this
                game, and Kossounou, the sole other centre-back in the squad is
                out (another COVID victim). This causes some issues and either
                Fuakala will be making his senior debut, or there will be some
                moving with defensive midfielder Balanta and/or left-back Ricca.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moving higher up the field, Rits will be cleaning up things
                behind the experienced central midfield duo Vormer and Vanaken.
                Vormer can also form a threat in the form of set pieces, with
                Vanaken frequently at the receiving end. Vanaken is the creative
                hub, in passing and shooting more than dribbling. Both Vormer
                and Vanaken often try to get the ball out to both flanks.
              </p>

                <figcaption>Photo description. Author's name</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                At these wings, the danger comes from Diatta, a fast-paced
                winger with good dribbling skills and with a dangerous strike in
                his feet. The other dangerous man on the wing is Dennis, he’s
                definitely also really pacey, but also a bit of a hit-or-miss
                player. He hasn’t played much this season because of transfer
                sorrows, and his form doesn’t seem to be there yet either.
                Chances are that he doesn’t start, in that case, academy
                prospect De Ketelaere, who made his debut last season in the
                Champions League and has been involved in most of the games
                recently, or fresh recruitment Lang are the likely replacements.
                The striking department is another uncertainty and has been an
                issue for more than a year now. Lately, powerful Krmenčík seems
                to have gotten the edge over young Badji, but he’s not available
                for this game either (the third COVID-positive). If they would
                play with two strikers, technically gifted Schrijvers is another
                option.
              </p>
              <h3>COACH</h3>
              <p>
                Philippe Clement knows all the ins and outs of the club, during
                his playing career he spent ten years in Brugge. He left the
                club briefly for spells as head coach at Beveren and Racing
                Genk, where he won the Belgian title before moving back to
                Brugge. In his first year he won the title again and had some
                decent performances at European level. Still a young manager,
                he’s already been very successful. He seems to prefer a 4-3-3
                formation, but a 3-5-2 is used frequently as well. Given the
                absence of a the latter seems more likely for the game in
                Saint-Petersburg, covering the defensive setback collectively
                while trying to counter and using the speed they have higher up
                the field.
              </p>
              <h3>THE SEASON SO FAR & EXPECTATIONS</h3>
              <p>
                Last Saturday, Brugge drew 1-1 away in a top game in the Belgian
                Pro League, away at Standard Liège. Overall, they lost the two
                of their first three games of the season but have been in
                excellent form ever since, winning five games in a row before
                the trip to Liège. This resulted in taking over top spot despite
                that shaky start. At times, they have looked very poor when
                trying to build up from the back, if a team presses them high up
                the field this might cause them trouble. On the other hand, the
                wingers have been making the difference, this will be a thing
                Zenit have to watch out for. Brugge obviously are not favourites
                in this group, but hope to advance in Europe nonetheless, be it
                in Europa League or in Champions League.
